### We're using 2 state management approaches in different branch for this project for nowüôÇ

## Bloc Pattern
These solution can be found in the [develop-bloc](https://github.com/hello-paulvin/city-cab/tree/develop-bloc) branch of these project
#### How we are using it
## UI/VIEW -> BLOC -> REPOSITORIES ‚ÜîÔ∏è SERVICES -> MODELS


The UI reponse to state changes in the [BLOC](https://pub.dev/packages?q=bloc), and data is fatch from the repositories while the services is for some dedicated services in the app; The Models blue-print our data from the server or anywhere from the app

## Provider
These solution can be found in the [develop-provider](https://github.com/hello-paulvin/city-cab/tree/develop-provider) branch of these project
#### How we are using it
## UI/VIEW -> STATE -> REPOSITORIES ‚ÜîÔ∏è SERVICES -> MODELS

The UI reponse to state changes in the [state(Provider)](https://pub.dev/packages?q=provider), and data is fatch from the repositories while the services is for some dedicated services in the app; The Models blue-print our data from the server or anywhere from the app
